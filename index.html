<p>Setting the right load order for your mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. LOOT can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.

<p>While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors such as incompatibilities and missing requirements, and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

<p>Over a million people worldwide use LOOT. It's free and open-source, so why not join them?
