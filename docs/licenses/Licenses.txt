BOSS is also distributed with some binaries for the following programs:

* GraphViz - Eclipse Public License v1.0; the text is not included as allowed by the license.

Going by what the EPL FAQ page says, simply running the GraphVis binaries through system calls does not make BOSS a "derivative work", and so it is not bound by the EPL, and so it's OK for BOSS to use GraphVis even though the EPL and GPL are incompatible.

Source code for all libraries and binaries can be found on the websites linked to in the main BOSS readme.
