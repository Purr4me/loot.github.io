{"name":"BOSS","tagline":"A load order optimisation tool for games using the Elder Scrolls Plugin/Master system.","body":"This site is for BOSS version 3 and later. Earlier versions of BOSS are hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/).\r\n\r\n### About BOSS\r\n\r\nBOSS is a plugin load order optimiser for TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. It is designed to assist mod users in avoiding detrimental conflicts, by automatically calculating a load order that satisfies all plugin dependencies and maximises each plugin's impact on the user's game.\r\n\r\nBOSS also provides some load order error checking, including checks for requirements, incompatibilities and cyclic dependencies. In addition, it provides a large number of plugin-specific usage notes, bug wawrnings and Bash Tag suggestions.\r\n\r\nAlthough BOSS is able to calculate the correct load order positions for the vast majority of mods without any user input, some plugins are designed to load at certain positions in a load order, and BOSS may be unable to determine this from the plugins themselves. As such, BOSS provides a mechanism for supplying additional plugin metadata so that it may sort them correctly.\r\n\r\nBOSS is intended to make using mods easier, and mod users should still possess a working knowledge of mod load ordering.\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n\r\nBOSS version 3 is currently in alpha testing. The latest stable release can be found at BOSS's old [Google Code site](https://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
